# Fairfax XdPUA

This is a modified version of the [Fairfax](https://www.kreativekorp.com/software/fonts/fairfax/) and [Fairfax HD](https://www.kreativekorp.com/software/fonts/fairfaxhd/) fonts by Kreative Software that supports the [Shidinn Alphabet PUA Encoding<sup>(zh)</sup>](https://wiki.xdi8.top/wiki/希顶字母PUA编码).

All Private Use Area glyphs except uF800 and the Shidinn block are removed. Shidinn characters are then given alternate codepoints in the range uE001 &ndash; uE138.
